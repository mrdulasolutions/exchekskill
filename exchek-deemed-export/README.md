# ExChek Deemed Export / Foreign National Review Skill (exchek-deemed-export)

Walks through **15 CFR 734.2(b)** to determine whether a “release” of technology or source code to a foreign national is a **deemed export** under the EAR. Covers nationality, technology vs. software, fundamental research, and license/exception. Produces a short **Deemed Export Review Memo** (deemed export applies / does not apply / recommend counsel).

- **Website:** https://exchek.us  

## What it does

- **Inputs:** Recipient (citizenship/nationality, immigration status), what is being released (technology/software description), context (employment, visit, collaboration), optional ECCN/classification, fundamental research or other carve-outs.
- **Outputs:** A filled **Deemed Export Review Memo** (markdown and optional .docx/.pages) with analysis and conclusion.

This skill does **not** perform classification or screening; it may consume user-provided classification and focuses solely on deemed-export analysis.
